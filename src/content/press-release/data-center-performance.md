## Strategic Significance for the Market and Investors

This partnership follows **ThisWay's rapid expansion** in the AI infrastructure market and strategic alliances with **NVIDIA, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, AWS** and others.

According to [Bain & Company's partner, David Crawford](https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4544210-1&h=4007657432&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bain.com%2Finsights%2Fais-trillion-dollar-opportunity-tech-report-2024%2F&a=Bain+%26+Company%27s+partner%2C+David+Crawford), the global AI and HPC market, of both data centers and hardware is **projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030**. ThisWay positions amalgamy.ai software as the intelligence layer that makes every data center, silicon chip and cloud investment more valuable, a defensible, category-defining advantage.

According to the [Stanford HAI AI Index Report 2025](https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4544210-1&h=2263698849&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhai.stanford.edu%2Fai-index%2F2025-ai-index-report&a=Stanford+HAI+AI+Index+Report+2025), AI adoption is accelerating globally, but compute access and readiness gaps persist. ThisWay and Mirantis directly address these challenges, **democratizing high-performance computing** through intelligent software, not only new hardware.
