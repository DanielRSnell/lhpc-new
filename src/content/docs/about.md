# About Sully + Amalgamy

**Sully + Amalgamy is the first platform that unifies operators, technical experts, and non-technical users around shared workflows — maximizing the impact of every GPU, accelerating revenue and adoption, and ensuring sovereignty without waste.**

## What It Is

Sully + Amalgamy is an agentic workflow orchestration platform for AI + HPC. It connects operators, technical experts, and non-technical users through shared workflows that run efficiently on bare-metal and cloud infrastructure.

### For Operators
Maximize revenue and utilization of GPU-rich clusters with intelligent multi-tenant orchestration and seamless bursting capabilities.

### For Technical Experts
Capture, optimize, and share workflows across HPC and AI environments. Build once, deploy everywhere — from on-prem clusters to neoclouds.

### For Non-Technical Users
Build and launch AI/HPC-powered applications without coding through Sully's agentic UX that generates workflows and interfaces from plain language descriptions.

### For Organizations
Ensure sovereignty, compliance, and flexibility while avoiding vendor lock-in across your entire infrastructure stack.

## The Challenge

Organizations investing in cutting-edge HPC and AI systems face common barriers that limit the value of their infrastructure investments:

### Underutilized GPUs
Specialized hardware sits idle in silos or is slowed by virtualization overhead. Organizations struggle to keep expensive accelerators productive across diverse workload types.

### Fragmented Workflows
Technical experts, analysts, and operators work in isolation, duplicating effort and creating workflow silos. Knowledge isn't captured or shared effectively across teams.

### Slow Adoption of New Silicon
Each new GPU or accelerator demands workflow rewrites before benefits can be realized. Organizations can't rapidly exploit the latest hardware innovations.

### Limited Observability
Leaders lack visibility into utilization, fairness, and compliance across their infrastructure. Without deep telemetry, optimization remains guesswork.

### Hyperscaler Pressure
Black-box cloud services are easy to consume but erode performance, margins, and sovereignty through virtualization overhead and vendor lock-in.

## Our Solution

Sully + Amalgamy provides a full-stack orchestration and UX layer that makes advanced infrastructure usable and profitable:

### Agentic UX (Sully)
Users describe outcomes in plain language; workflows and user interfaces are generated automatically. Non-technical users can harness complex HPC and AI capabilities without coding.

### Shared Workflow Layer
Technical experts capture workflows once and replay them across clusters, clouds, or edge environments. Knowledge becomes portable and reusable across the organization.

### High-Performance Multi-Tenancy
Enable bare-metal sharing without virtualization overhead. Multiple teams and workloads coexist securely while maintaining full hardware performance.

### Parallel Scheduling + Observability
HPC batch jobs and AI containers run side by side, with deep visibility and intelligent optimization. Keep every accelerator hot across diverse workload types.

### OEM-Agnostic Portability
Works across Dell, HPE, Supermicro, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel — future-proofing hardware investments. Avoid vendor lock-in while exploiting the latest innovations from every manufacturer.

### Seamless Bursting
Extend on-prem workloads into neocloud operators for hybrid flexibility. Scale dynamically without refactoring workflows or compromising sovereignty.

## Outcomes

### Accelerate Revenue
Onboard tenants and workloads in days, not weeks. Multi-tenant capabilities unlock new revenue streams from existing infrastructure.

### Maximize Utilization
Keep GPUs and accelerators hot across AI + HPC workloads. Achieve 57-85% more throughput per cycle through intelligent orchestration.

### Broaden Adoption
Empower non-technical users with agentic workflows and interfaces. Democratize access to advanced capabilities across the organization.

### Simplify Collaboration
Shared workflows align technical and non-technical teams around common processes. Reduce duplication and accelerate time-to-value.

### Ensure Sovereignty
Maintain policy control, fairness, and compliance across all deployments. Meet regulatory requirements without sacrificing performance.

### Future-Proof Hardware
Realize the benefits of new silicon immediately, without refactoring delays. Rapidly adopt the latest GPUs and accelerators as they become available.

## Why Sully + Amalgamy vs Alternatives

### DIY Stacks
Brittle, costly, and slow to adapt to new hardware. Require extensive in-house expertise to build and maintain.

### OEM Consoles
Vendor lock-in with no interoperability across manufacturers. Limited to specific hardware ecosystems.

### Hyperscaler Services
Easy to consume but virtualized, expensive, and sovereignty-breaking. Performance degradation through abstraction layers.

### Traditional Cluster Managers
Costly licenses with limited AI/HPC convergence capabilities. Built for legacy batch scheduling, not modern agentic workflows.

### Sully + Amalgamy Advantage
The only solution combining agentic UX, workflow portability, bare-metal multi-tenancy, bursting capabilities, and deep observability in a single unified platform.

## How It Works

### 1. Portability as Anchor
Capture workflows once, replay across on-prem clusters, neoclouds, sovereign clouds, and edge environments. True write-once, run-anywhere capability.

### 2. Multi-Tenant Enablement
Secure, policy-driven sharing of infrastructure across teams and organizations. Maintain isolation without virtualization overhead.

### 3. Parallel Scheduling
Orchestrate HPC and AI workloads side by side, keeping every accelerator productive. Intelligent scheduling maximizes utilization across diverse job types.

### 4. Agentic UX Expansion
Make advanced workflows consumable by non-technical users through natural language interfaces. Democratize access to sophisticated capabilities.

### 5. Optimization & Observability
Continuous telemetry and recommendations for fairness, compliance, and efficiency. Data-driven optimization across the entire infrastructure stack.

## Proof and ROI

### Utilization Gains
Up to 57-85% more throughput per cycle through intelligent orchestration and bare-metal multi-tenancy.

### Rapid Onboarding
New workloads deployed in days, not weeks. Accelerate time-to-value for new tenants and use cases.

### Performance Efficiency
Exploit the full performance of the latest GPUs and accelerators without virtualization tax. Maintain bare-metal speeds in multi-tenant environments.

### Workflow Reuse
Cross-team workflows reused and extended instead of rebuilt. Reduce duplication and accelerate development cycles.

### Compliance Accountability
Workflow-level observability meets compliance and audit needs. Maintain detailed records for regulatory requirements.
