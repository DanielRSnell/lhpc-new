# General/Generic for a Solution Brief

*“Sully \+ LaunchHPC is the first platform that unifies operators, technical experts, and non-technical users around shared workflows maximizing the impact of every GPU, accelerating revenue and adoption, and ensuring sovereignty without waste.”*

## What It Is

Sully \+ LaunchHPC is an agentic workflow orchestration platform for AI \+ HPC. It connects operators, technical experts, and non-technical users through shared workflows that run efficiently on bare-metal and cloud infrastructure.

* For operators: Maximize revenue and utilization of GPU-rich clusters.  
* For technical experts: Capture, optimize, and share workflows across HPC and AI.  
* For non-technical users: Build and launch AI/HPC-powered applications without coding.  
* For organizations: Ensure sovereignty, compliance, and flexibility while avoiding lock-in.

## The Challenge

Organizations investing in cutting-edge HPC and AI systems face common barriers:

* Underutilized GPUs: Specialized hardware sits idle in silos or is slowed by virtualization.  
* Fragmented workflows: Technical experts, analysts, and operators work in isolation, duplicating effort.  
* Slow adoption of new silicon: Each new GPU or accelerator demands workflow rewrites before benefits are realized.  
* Limited observability: Leaders lack visibility into utilization, fairness, and compliance.  
* Hyperscaler pressure: Black-box services are easy to consume but erode performance, margins, and sovereignty.

## Our Solution

Sully \+ LaunchHPC provides a full-stack orchestration and UX layer that makes advanced infrastructure usable and profitable:

* Agentic UX (Sully): Users describe outcomes in plain language; workflows and UIs are generated automatically.  
* Shared Workflow Layer: Technical experts capture workflows once and replay them across clusters, clouds, or edge.  
* High-Performance Multi-Tenancy: Bare-metal sharing without virtualization overhead.  
* Parallel Scheduling \+ Observability: HPC batch jobs and AI containers run side by side, with deep visibility and optimization.  
* OEM-Agnostic Portability: Works across Dell, HPE, Supermicro, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel — future-proofing hardware investments.  
* Seamless Bursting: Customers can extend on-prem workloads into neocloud operators for hybrid flexibility.

## Outcomes

* Accelerate revenue: Onboard tenants and workloads in days, not weeks.  
* Maximize utilization: Keep GPUs and accelerators hot across AI \+ HPC.  
* Broaden adoption: Empower non-technical users with agentic workflows and UIs.  
* Simplify collaboration: Shared workflows align technical and non-technical teams.  
* Ensure sovereignty: Maintain policy control, fairness, and compliance across deployments.  
* Future-proof hardware: Realize the benefits of new silicon immediately, without refactoring delays.

## Why Sully \+ LaunchHPC vs Alternatives

* DIY stacks: Brittle, costly, and slow to adapt to new hardware.  
* OEM consoles: Lock-in, no interoperability across vendors.  
* Hyperscaler services: Easy but virtualized, expensive, and sovereignty-breaking.  
* Cluster managers: Costly licenses, limited AI/HPC convergence.  
* Sully \+ LaunchHPC advantage: The only solution combining agentic UX, workflow portability, bare-metal multi-tenancy, bursting, and deep observability in one platform.

## How It Works

1. Portability as Anchor: Capture workflows once, replay across on-prem, clouds, and edge.  
2. Multi-Tenant Enablement: Secure, policy-driven sharing of infrastructure.  
3. Parallel Scheduling: Orchestrate HPC and AI side by side, keeping every accelerator hot.  
4. Agentic UX Expansion: Make advanced workflows consumable by non-technical users.  
5. Optimization & Observability: Continuous telemetry and recommendations for fairness, compliance, and efficiency.

## Proof and ROI

* Utilization: Up to 20–30% more throughput per cycle.  
* Onboarding: New workloads deployed in days, not weeks.  
* Efficiency: Exploit the full performance of the latest GPUs/accelerators without virtualization tax.  
* Collaboration: Cross-team workflows reused and extended instead of rebuilt.  
* Accountability: Workflow-level observability meets compliance and audit needs.

## Procurement and Rollout

* Delivered as a software license, OEM-integrated appliance, or SaaS service.  
* Flexible deployment: on-prem clusters, neoclouds, sovereign clouds, or hybrid environments.  
* Includes pre-production/testing licenses.  
* Backed by a compliance-ready support model (StateRAMP roadmap).

## Design Partner Program

* Early access to Sully \+ LaunchHPC features.  
* Joint roadmap shaping for portability, UX, and optimization.  
* Co-marketing with operators, OEMs, and public sector innovators.  
* Priority support and training for all personas — operators, technical teams, and non-technical users.
