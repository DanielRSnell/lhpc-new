https://launchhpc.com/product,The images from the DEMO are NOT appropriate,Can we size them a lot smaller and pixelate the heck out of them so they are not readable if examined?

https://launchhpc.com/,"CTA Links don't all work, the ones that do all go to the same scheduling page","Multiple dead buttons throughout. Why have 2 buttons next to each other that say different things but go to the same place? Ex: ""Schedule a demo"", ""Contact Sales""  If that's deliberate bc it is proven to drive traffic, so be it.","(Justin) | Daniel Reply - There is nothing really to send them too at the moment. I can remove the buttons but it will throw off the sections. Originally the goal was it would have docs / CTAs but since its a preview version sending them to schedule a meeting is the normal approach but happy to take whatever direction everyone thinks is best. - ** I did finish updating links to make sure nothing was broken.

,,"Partnered with NVIDIA, SuperMicro, Mirantis, IBM, Microsoft, AWS, TDSynnex","Angela | Angela Hood Justin Hood do you mean for this to be above the fold on the home page? The logos will make the hero very busy, i'd recommend keeping their placement, its very normal for trust badges to go in section two, I think this is worth changing once we have clients / case studies though as that would call out more trust than partner logos.
