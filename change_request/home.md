4. Limited Observability
   Icon: Eye (closed or limited)
   Description: "Leaders lack visibility into utilization, fairness, and compliance across infrastructure, making optimization guesswork instead of data-driven."

5. Vendor Lock-In
   Icon: Lock (closed)
   Description: "Hyperscaler services and OEM consoles create vendor lock-in through proprietary APIs, eroding sovereignty and limiting flexibility."
```

### Design Notes
- Grid layout: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- Each card has icon, title, and description
- Subtle dark/muted styling to convey "problem" state
- Icons from lucide-react
- Keep concise - 1-2 sentences per problem

4. **Emphasize sovereignty:** No vendor lock-in, full control
5. **Future-proof:** Immediate silicon adoption without refactoring

### Terminology Consistency:
- "Bare-metal multi-tenancy" (not "bare metal" or "baremetal")
- "Workflow portability" (not "portable workflows")
- "OEM-agnostic" (not "vendor-agnostic" or "hardware-agnostic")
- "20-30% utilization gains" (consistent metric)
- "Days vs. weeks" (for onboarding time)
- "On-premises" (hyphenated, not "on-prem" in formal copy)

---

## Success Metrics

## Open Questions

1. **Partner Logo Usage:** Do we have permission/agreements to display Dell, Supermicro, NVIDIA logos on the site?
2. **Quantified Metrics:** Can we validate the "20-30% utilization gains" and "days vs. weeks" claims with customer data?
3. **StateRAMP Status:** What's the current status of StateRAMP compliance roadmap?
4. **Industry Case Studies:** Do we have any customer logos or testimonials we can feature in Industry Use Cases section?
5. **Competitive Claims:** Have legal/marketing reviewed the competitive table for accuracy and defensibility?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Content Review:** Stakeholder review and approval of proposed changes
2. **Design Mockups:** Create visual designs for new sections (Problem Statement, Persona Tabs, Competitive Table, etc.)
3. **Development Estimate:** Size the implementation effort and timeline
4. **Partner Approval:** Secure permission to use partner logos
5. **Legal Review:** Validate competitive claims and quantified metrics
6. **Content Writing:** Finalize copy for all new sections
7. **Implementation:** Execute in phases per priority schedule
